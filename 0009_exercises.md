Multiples of 3 and 5
--------------------

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


Even and odd numbers
--------------------

Write a program that will do the following:

    * ask a user to give a number, let's call it N
    * ask a user to give N numbers
    * print how many even and odd numbers a user has given

Example of what user may see:

    How many numbers would you like to enter? 6
    3
    10
    4
    7
    2
    8
    Even numbers: 4
    Odd numbers: 2

Now write a function that will accept a list as argument and
will return 2-element tuple where the first element is a list
of odd numbers and the second element is a list of even numbers.

Now modify your program so that it calls this function to
and uses its result to print how many even and odd numbers
a user has given.
